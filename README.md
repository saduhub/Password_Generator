## Description

This project is a password generator that makes use of TypeScript. The motivation behind building this project was to demonstrate proficiency in working with TypeScript. By creating this password generator, I aimed to showcase my skills in designing and implementing an application that offers the ability to generate a new password based on several parameters.

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into the following areas:
  
- **TypeScript and Type-Safe Coding**: Using TypeScript has increased my understanding of statically typed languages in the JavaScript ecosystem. I have become familiar with type annotations, interfaces, type inference, function type annotations, and tsconfig.json to ensure type-safety throughout my applications. By making use of TypeScript's compiler and advanced type-checking features, I've been able to catch potential bugs early and streamline the refactoring process. This approach to coding has made my applications more maintainable and helped cultivate the habit of writing self-documenting and predictable code.
